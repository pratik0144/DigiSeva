    content: `UPI is safe — but only if YOU are careful.

Rules to never break:
1. You NEVER need to enter your UPI PIN to RECEIVE money. PIN is only for SENDING.
2. Never scan a QR code sent by a stranger — scammers send fake QR codes that deduct money.
3. Never click "Request Money" links from unknown numbers.
4. Your UPI PIN is like your ATM PIN — never share it with anyone, not even bank staff.
5. If someone says "I'm sending you money, approve this request" — that is a SCAM. Hang up.

Real example: A vegetable seller in Pune lost ₹8,000 by scanning a QR code a "customer" sent on WhatsApp. The QR code was a payment request, not a payment.

What to do if scammed: Call 1930 (National Cyber Crime Helpline) immediately.`

Example:
If you save ₹500 every month in a Recurring Deposit (RD) at 7% interest:
- After 1 year: ₹6,000 saved → you get ₹6,230 (₹230 extra)
- After 5 years: ₹30,000 saved → you get ₹35,900 (₹5,900 extra)
- After 10 years: ₹60,000 saved → you get ₹86,900 (₹26,900 extra)

The longer you save, the more free money you earn.

Best options for rural India:
- Post Office RD: Available at every post office, minimum ₹100/month
- SBI RD: Minimum ₹100/month, 6.8% interest (2025 rate)
- Jan Dhan account savings: Earns 4% interest automatically

Start today: Even ₹50/month matters.
₹50/month for 20 years at 7% = ₹26,000+ in your account.`

RED FLAGS — these are SCAMS:

3. App asks for full access to your contacts and photos — they will blackmail you
4. Interest rate not clearly mentioned upfront
5. No RBI registration number mentioned — check at rbi.org.in

Safe loan options:
- PM Mudra Yojana: Up to ₹10 lakh, through real banks
- Kisan Credit Card: For farmers, through nationalized banks
- SHG loans: Through Self Help Groups in your village

    content: `A Self Help Group (SHG) is a small group of 10-20 people (usually women) who save together and help each other.

How it works:
1. Group meets weekly or monthly
2. Everyone saves a small amount (₹50-200)
3. The pooled money can be lent to members at low interest
4. After 6 months, banks give loans to the group at 7% interest (normal moneylenders charge 36-60%)

Benefits:
- Escape from local moneylenders who charge huge interest
- Loans for house repair, children's education, medical emergency
- Under NRLM (National Rural Livelihood Mission), government gives ₹10,000 revolving fund to each SHG free
- Bank linkage loans: ₹1-10 lakh at 7% after track record

How to join or form one:
- Contact your Gram Panchayat or Anganwadi worker
- Or contact nearest bank's RSETi (Rural Self Employment Training Institute)
- Search: nrlm.gov.in to find SHGs in your area

Over 9 crore women are part of SHGs in India (2025).`

This is called AePS (Aadhaar-enabled Payment System) fraud.

How to protect yourself RIGHT NOW:
1. Lock your Aadhaar biometrics:
   - Go to myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in
   - Click "Lock/Unlock Biometrics"
   - Lock it — unlock only when YOU go to a bank or govt office

2. Never give fingerprint to unknown agents at your door

3. Check your Aadhaar transaction history:
   - SMS "UIDAI" to 1947
   - Or check resident.uidai.gov.in

4. If fraud happens:
   - Call UIDAI helpline: 1947
   - Call bank immediately to freeze account
   - File complaint: cybercrime.gov.in

Important: Locking biometrics does NOT affect your Aadhaar for other uses like SIM, passport, or govt documents.`

    content: `Many rural families borrow from local moneylenders without realizing how much they actually pay back.

Real comparison for ₹10,000 loan:

Local moneylender (3% per month):
- Monthly interest: ₹300
- After 1 year — you paid ₹3,600 in interest
- The original ₹10,000 is STILL owed
- Total paid after 2 years if only paying interest: ₹7,200 — and still owe ₹10,000

Bank loan (12% per year):
- Monthly EMI for 1 year: ₹888
- Total paid: ₹10,656
- Loan fully closed — nothing more owed

Post Office / SHG loan (7% per year):
- Monthly EMI for 1 year: ₹870
- Total paid: ₹10,440
- Loan fully closed

Key lesson:
"3% per month" sounds small but is 36% per year — 3x more than a bank.

Always ask: "What is the annual interest rate?" (Saalaana byaaj kitna hai?)

Emergency loan options (in order of preference):
1. SHG loan (7%)
2. Jan Dhan overdraft (0% for first 6 months)
3. PM Mudra loan through bank (10-12%)
4. AVOID: local moneylender (36-120%)`
